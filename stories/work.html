            <h5>Where I started</h5>
            <p>In a previous life and in the days before swiping right, I co-founded <a href="http://socialblendr.com">Social Blendr</a> with <a href="http://www.khaliqgant.com">@khaliqgant</a>. Our mission was to end loneliness. We failed; people are lonely. It was fun, though.

            <p>Before that I tried my hand selling wine in China. I flew to the opposite side of the world to sell something I don't drink in a language I never spoke; suck it haters! <a href="http://finewines.willigant.com/RyanDoglione/">Bravado was not something we lacked</a>. Funding, licences and a general plan, however, were.</p>

        <li>
            <p> That was all powered by success with <a class="no" href="http://www.connectedgreek.com"><span class="cg">ConnectedGreek</span></a>. What started as a chore project in college turned into a full fledged business when I graduated. For five years we created websites and provided tools for organizations on college campuses across the country.</p>

            <p> However, my first startup will always have a special place in my heart. We purchased text books on Amazon and sold them on campus at a significant discount as compared to the local bookstore. At the time, the margins were pretty huge!</p>
