# I promise I'm not this vain in real life
    
It's hard making a website about yourself without coming across as at least a _little_ self indulged.

```PHP
<?php 

$var = 'foo';

class Bar extends Biz {

    var $foo;

    public __construct() {
        $this->foo = 1;
    }
    
    public function go() {
        // do stuff
        //do other stuff
    }

}
```

If the url didn’t fool you, I’m Will Washburn: an entrepreneur trying to make it in New York City. I love startups, making it happen, and my navy blue blazer. I’m also known to tear up the dance floor.
I co-founded Social Blendr with my best friend Khaliq Gant. We help people find new friends to hang out with.
I grew up in the  cranberry capital of the world, went to the school by the sea, became a hatter, built some software, moved to the queen city, played some basketball, tried to sell a product half way across the world, and wound up in the greatest city on the planet doing something I love.
I was blessed with an awesome family.My sister is amazingly talented and smart. She gives the best advice and sometimes I think I’m cheating by having all her answers to life’s hard problems.My mom is the most caring and sweet woman you can find, she can make anyone smile, and I’m proud to have gotten her “goofy” genes.My dad is the smartest guy I know and, fortunately, cared enough to teach me some of what he knew as I grew up. I had a leg up on everybody. He’s one of those guys that you learn something every time you talk to him.My grandfather is the most incredible human being I’ve ever met and I can only hope to grow up to be half the man that he is.
Still want to know more? Really? That was a lot of personal information. Are you trying to figure out my pants size or something? Just contact me on Twitter and we’ll talk about it.
Fine. 32/33.

I'm also a full stack web developer that likes to play with technology that I can use in hackathons. That wasn't supposed to sound like a joke, but it did.
