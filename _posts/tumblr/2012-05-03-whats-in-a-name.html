<p>My name is the same name as my father’s name. Which is the same name as his father’s name. This is a really long way of saying that I am a “third”.</p>
<p>William Frederick Washburn III, to be exact.</p>
<p>From a young age I was called Bill, which is short for William. I’m not sure why we have short names, since William isn’t that hard to say and really just leads to confusion during roll call - but we do and Bill was mine.</p>
<p>It became apart of who I was. I placed it on my homework and jackets and that let people know those were mine. When people asked me who I was, instead of describing myself it was ok just to say “Bill” and they would, somehow, understand.</p>
<p>I was “Bill” Washburn.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 7th grade that I realized I could change it. See, around this time Will Smith came out with an album called “Big Willie Style” (it had some great hits like “Getting Jiggy with it” and “Miami”). My sister bought this for me as my first CD and as a result, I thought Will Smith was the coolest.</p>
<p>So I took his name.</p>
<p>I was too afraid to tell anyone though, so I just started writing it on my papers and tests. It never caused too much of a stir, since my teachers would see the last name and figure it out. Not that it would matter, since all my friends called me Bill anyways. You can’t just change your name amongst your peers.</p>
<p>That all changed in 2001. I applied to Tabor Academy, and as had become routine when filing of any paperwork, I wrote my name as “Will” Washburn on all the applications. After I eventually got in and arrived on campus, I was asked to put on a nametag - a pre-printed nametag for “Will” Washburn. All these new people would now know me as “Will”.</p>
<p>After a few months, I started to have friends who only knew me as “Will”. Bill was like a dirty little secret, someone from my past who I had forgotten about. My parents and friends from back home, however, remembered him. And he was me.</p>
<p>I insisted that people who knew me as Bill continued to call me so, so as to not make them go through learning a new name. I still have birthday cards that start with “Dear W/Bill” because people just didn’t know what I wanted to be called. It was a mess.</p>
<p>People who knew me as “Will” would say things like “I could never see you as a Bill, it’s so&hellip; dorky”. People who knew me as “Bill” would say things like “You’re kidding, people don’t seriously call you Will? You’re trying too hard”.</p>
<p>Was my name changing how people perceived me? Was I different person as Bill (dorky) than I was as Will (trying to hard)? You might find this to be minutiae, but as a teenager this was life changing stuff.</p>
<p>I felt cooler as Will, emulating the Will I thought was awesome at the time. I had a little bit more swagger. Bill, then, was the kid who would turn bright red when he spoke in front of the class. Bill was dorky. Bill was the past.</p>
<p>So was I dorky because I was Bill, or because I was dorky? Self-perception is innately difficult and names often help us see through the fog. I don’t just mean given names, but nicknames as well. Names help us see ourselves for who we are and who we want to be. I think they can also be reverse engineered. That is, calling yourself something can help you become that something. By changing my name to Will, I started to emulate the cool “Will Smith” and leave behind “Dorky Bill” (the irony here of cool Will Smith is killing me now).</p>
<p>Or maybe names don’t matter at all, and who you are shines through anyway. Either way, I have a basketball game tonight so call me MJ.</p>
