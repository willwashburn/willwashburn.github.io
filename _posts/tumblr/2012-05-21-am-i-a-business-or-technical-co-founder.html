<p><span>There seems to be a lot of hub-bub lately about “business” co-founders and “technical” co-founders and it made me wonder which one I am.  Am I considered technical? What makes someone more &ldquo;business&rdquo; than the other? For that matter, what makes someone &ldquo;technical&rdquo;? Is there a minimum coding ability required or does anybody who has used excel macros count? Where do we draw the line? </span></p>
<p>On one hand, I write a lot of code; so I must be technical. I&rsquo;ve had my hand in every level of our product, from setting up the production server to slicing and designing in Photoshop. I spend most of my day in the terminal or an IDE. I dream in code. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I do a lot of networking, sales calls and planning the vision; so I must be business. Anytime I&rsquo;m not writing code I&rsquo;m answering emails or writing invoices. I might even be at the white board reevaluating our message - or drafting some hair-brained way to gain some interest in what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t possibly be both right?</p>
<p><span>There seems to be an unspoken.. disdain.. for business people. As if they have more to prove than the so called &ldquo;technical&rdquo; co-founders. I can understand the sentiment; it only takes 1 or 2 &ldquo;business&rdquo; people explaining &ldquo;their idea&rdquo; that you should &ldquo;just make&rdquo; before you resent them. My issue with this, however, is that it almost makes being the &ldquo;business&rdquo; guy seem inferior. Are those tasks less important? I think not.</span></p>
<p><span>For an early stage startup like ours, we have to be &ldquo;busnical&rdquo; co-founders. That is, Khaliq can&rsquo;t just code and I can&rsquo;t just schmooze (or vice versa). We both move pretty fluidly between roles and fill in where the other has trouble or is stuck. That isn&rsquo;t to say we don&rsquo;t lead each other where we excel, but for the most part we consider each other equals on both fronts. We do whatever we have to do to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t understand why everyone is &ldquo;looking for a technical co-founder&rdquo; as if that&rsquo;s all they need. If you can&rsquo;t code, learn how to. If you aren&rsquo;t a good networker, learn to be one. If you can&rsquo;t balance a budget or understand some marketing techniques - learn. </span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m not saying become an expert in everything, but as a co-founder you need to be at least proficient in them all and damn good in one. With that in mind we shouldn&rsquo;t be finding &ldquo;technical&rdquo; or &ldquo;business&rdquo; co-founders, we should be looking for &ldquo;busnical&rdquo; ones.</span></p>
<p><span>Which is why I&rsquo;m honored to have <a href="http://blog.khaliqgant.com">Khaliq</a> on my team, because he&rsquo;s probably the best &ldquo;busnical&rdquo; co-founder you could hope for.</span></p>
