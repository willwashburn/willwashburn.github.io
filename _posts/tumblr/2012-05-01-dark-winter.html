<p>My last blog post was over 4 months ago. Safe to say I went dark.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, my mind went with it. Blogging is a bit cathartic, and its one of the things I’d like to keep doing: along with eating, working out, yoga, staying social and writing code.  </p>
<p>I have four or five “half posts” that, after reading a few weeks later, show a guy in an incredibly dark place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You aren’t a special snowflake, Will.</p>
<p>You are weak. You can’t do it. You’re emotional. You don’t get anything done. You’re soft, stop lying to everyone. You can’t keep this up. Sweet bank account, pal. Notice how everyone else has an awesome job? You never were good at making decisions. You thought you wouldn’t be affected? You seriously thought you were above that? How arrogant are you? You aren’t a real programmer, remember? You use PHP for god’s sake, like all amateurs! Your ex was right, you need direction. Her mother was right about you too. What are you even doing? When are you going to get a real job? I bet your grandfather is disappointed in you. How long are you going to pretend that you’re ok? How long can you act like you’re good enough to create something from nothing when you ARE nothing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>It’s been a dark winter, one where bad news was easier to find than the good variety. Not to say great things didn’t happen - but rather I didn’t let myself see them. I focused on the bad.</p>
<p>I can paint a picture about the last four months both ways, and perhaps I could have blogged the whole time about sunshine and flowers instead of what I had been writing. Perhaps then I would have published it. </p>
<p>I feel compelled to paint a “pretty” picture of who we are and what we’ve been doing because we’re trying to raise money - who would want to invest in someone who wrote what’s above? I wanted to hide all that emotion and self doubt about what we are doing. So I saved these drafts, put them away and kept on going - hoping those feelings would dissipate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of going away, those feelings snowballed. It wasn’t until I confronted them that they were subdued. Posting this is part of that process, letting those feelings pass through me instead of building up. As much as I want to edit and censor this post, it’ll do me no good in the long run.</p>
<p>I’ve come to realize that the most important thing is keeping your mind right. I had been putting in too many hours and not taking care of myself - I was off balance. I thought I was better than everyone else, that despite all the blog posts and books I’ve read warning about burnout and losing control it wouldn’t happen to me. </p>
<p>I thought I was different.</p>
<p>Turns out, I’m not a special snowflake after all. </p>
