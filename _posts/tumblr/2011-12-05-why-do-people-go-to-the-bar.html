<p>We recently had an interesting conversation with some really smart people about WHY people would want to use <a href="http://www.socialblendr.com">Social Blendr</a>. Their line of thinking went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Why would I go out unless I was trying to get laid? I either am looking for a girl, or just talking to my friends. You&rsquo;re a dating site, and the dating market is tough, if not impossible, to break into.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>My immediate reaction was probably too defensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What?! You mean you don&rsquo;t go to the bar to be social?! People want to be social! Being social is fun!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back, I was being too general. I had no data to back that up, just my own experience on the topic. I like being social and meeting new people when I go out, but perhaps not everyone likes to. Maybe everyone is secretly (or not so secretly) just trying to get laid.</p>
<p>When I lived in Charlotte, I used to go out <em>alone</em> and try to meet <em>guys</em>. As a straight man, this is a tough proposition. Most guys were only comfortable in their own groups and were, gasp, just looking for girls. My question is why? Are people fundamentally opposed to making platonic non-romantic relationships? </p>
<p>My gut tells me, no it screams at me,  NO. OF COURSE NOT.</p>
<p>People, girls and guys both, need their time with their respective sexes. We all want friends, and friends most certainly come and go. So just like in dating, we need outlets to replace them.</p>
<p>Before online dating, we did just fine finding dates. Online dating is now close to a billion dollar industry. </p>
<p>Before anything like Social Blendr exists, we are doing fine making friends. Do you think there is a friendship market? If there is one, I think dating would be inside it. Would you rather go on a dating site or one where there wasn&rsquo;t such a explicit implication? One of my favorite <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23kjgisms">#KJGisms</a> comes to mind: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Desperation is a stinky cologne&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is how we make friends and grow our real life &ldquo;social network&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t changed. How we meet and interact with people in person hasn&rsquo;t changed. We can do better, and we will. </p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>The tricky part with platonic friend acquisition (PFA) is the motive. In a bar type setting, a guy approaching a girl has a pretty clear motive; dating. Even if it&rsquo;s not the case, the stage is such that it&rsquo;s expected and considered ok. </p>
<p>If you were going to approach someone as a friend, you would need some rapport. It&rsquo;s just how people are, and I don&rsquo;t see that changing very much.</p>
<p>What I can see changing is how we build that rapport.  And judging from <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/13783947907/it-definitely-felt-sixy">our last event</a>, I think we&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>
