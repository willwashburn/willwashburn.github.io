<p>I&rsquo;ve asked my dad a thousand times to get a twitter account. I convinced my sister to start a tumblr. I sync&rsquo;d my mom&rsquo;s calendar to her iPhone and iPad because, I promise, it&rsquo;ll be easier for her. I bought my grandfather and iPad, my ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s mother an iPod (so they could Facetime instead of call!) and got everyone I could find to use Kik. If I&rsquo;m into a service, I always end up pitching it to anybody who will listen.</p>
<p>The fact is, all this cool tech isn&rsquo;t any fun without the people I want to use it with. We want to message and tweet and share with eachother because ultimately it improves our experience, and it&rsquo;s fun to show people cool new stuff.</p>
<p>That SOUNDS all fine and dandy, but not all services are made the same. I didn&rsquo;t try to get my friends on Sonar, or my family on Path, or my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; friends on foursquare.</p>
<p>I recently had a conversation about this with @lukehri; the value in these services is not the features, but who is using it. He&rsquo;s been able to convince his family to use Path, I never bothered to try. He loves it, I&rsquo;ve deleted it from my phone. What made Luke push it and me let is slip through the cracks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just a function of our own opinion of the service. I&rsquo;m not going to recommend things I don&rsquo;t think are cool. Then again, I think Path is pretty sweet but the idea of pitching it to my Mom sounds daunting. WHY would she do this? How does it beat an email thread? Who gets to see it? She doesn&rsquo;t have time for this.</p>
<p>Finding this &ldquo;Pushability&rdquo; of a product should be paramount. Make your product easy to pitch and grab the normals. Being brutally honest, this is something we do pretty poorly with Social Blendr and in the next few months it will be at the top of our FIX list.</p>
