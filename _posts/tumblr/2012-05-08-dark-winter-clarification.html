<p>I wrote <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/22196883882/dark-winter">this post</a> as my jump back into blogging and the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/blog-so-hard-challenge">Blog So Hard Challenge</a>&rdquo;. I seem to have confused some people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sad. I&rsquo;m not a victim. I am certainly not unlucky or suffering from some unfair life disadvantage.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s precisely the opposite. I have had more advantages and loving people around me than 99.9% of the world. I wake up every morning and work on an interesting problem in a way that I see fit. I am healthy and fortunate in every way possible. I&rsquo;ve been given every opportunity at every stage of my life and been supported no matter if I screwed up or not. </p>
<p>Said another way, I have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>My point in that post was a simple one: it&rsquo;s time to stop pretending. Regardless of my advantages I haven&rsquo;t found the success that I&rsquo;ve been seeking and it&rsquo;s been a bit of an emotional roller-coaster.</p>
<p>You might say I&rsquo;m being a little sensitive and should just &ldquo;man up&rdquo;. I would argue that I am.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a shame that admitting emotion is considered weak. I think many people in this industry (and others) struggle with self-doubt and emotional distress, but bottle it up and eventually burn out. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to act tough and pretend it all doesn&rsquo;t bother you. There is no vulnerability in being above it all. </p>
<p>I believe it takes someone with real strength to confront their emotions and admit weakness. It is not a cry for help, but rather a statement that</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;yeah, this is hard for me.. but I&rsquo;m still going to make it happen&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>There is strength in honesty, especially when the truth is difficult to admit.</p>
