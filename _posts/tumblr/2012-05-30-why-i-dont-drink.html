<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a beer. I&rsquo;ve never been drunk, wasted, blacked out, sloshed, plastered, hammered or any other of the many terms for being over-indulgently inebriated.</p>
<p>Yet, time and time again people come up to me and say that, while I probably don&rsquo;t remember, I was super drunk when they saw me.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a defensive maneuver on my part, and I acted that way to stop the inevitable barrage of questions that come from admitting I don&rsquo;t drink. Perhaps it&rsquo;s assumed from context, as one who is at a bar at 2am was, more than likely, drunk - especially with all that dancing going on. Perhaps people see what they want and don&rsquo;t like the idea that someone was sober. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just conversation.</p>
<p>Whatever the reality is, when people find out I don&rsquo;t drink they always want to know; why?</p>
<p>It seems incomprehensible that I just choose not to, so people always ask a series of mildly amusing questions. </p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Are you super religious?<br/>Are you allergic?! <br/>Are you a recovering alcoholic?!<br/>Does anyone in your family drink? <br/>Do you hate fun? SUNSHINE?!<br/>WHY WOULD YOU NOT DRINK, YOU SEEM NORMAL?! </p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The real reason is, of course,  a much simpler answer than these types of questions imply. There is no long story, no heart wrenching tale about how I overcame some battle with booze; The truth is that I just would prefer to be sober.</p>
<p>Yes, I <em>prefer</em> sobriety. I like to be sober. (this is where my date gets up and leaves me at dinner -true story). I know what you&rsquo;re thinking - how can I know?</p>
<p>There is a chance that I don&rsquo;t know how great it is to be drunk, and that I am really missing out. That sober is this horrible state, and that the haze of liquor is something I would be stupid not to enjoy. Don&rsquo;t knock it until you&rsquo;ve tried it, as the saying goes. </p>
<p>The truth is I don&rsquo;t mind not drinking and see plenty of reasons not to start.</p>
<p>Hangovers don&rsquo;t seem fun. Drinks are really expensive, especially in a city like New York. I don&rsquo;t need the extra calories at 2AM, especially if my sugar addiction stays as constant. I get a kick out of toying with drunk people with my sudden advantage in intellect, one that would disappear if I too were drunk. I have a ton of fun being sober - why would I change that?</p>
<p>How can I go out and still have fun? Most people ask this because whenever they go out sober they are miserable. They point to the alcohol as the reason they can have fun. &ldquo;Liquid Courage&rdquo; makes conversation easier and more things happen. I can totally see the correlation.</p>
<p>However, correlation does not mean causation. Attitude can be adjusted. No one <em>needs</em> to drink to have fun. </p>
<p>Try it. Go to a bar and introduce yourself to someone you don&rsquo;t know. Dance. Say something you wouldn&rsquo;t normally say. Play the rejection game. Smile. Act drunk if it makes it easier. Create your own &ldquo;liquid courage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying everyone should quit drinking. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s entirely bad and I think for some people, it&rsquo;s a great shortcut to being social and &ldquo;loosening up&rdquo;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just suggesting it&rsquo;s ok to party without the shortcut, too.</p>
