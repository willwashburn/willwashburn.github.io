<p>Finding your blogging voice is a bit like dancing. At first, you&rsquo;re aware of every little movement you make. You wonder if people are watching you and making fun of your terrible, off beat movements. It feels plain awkward. You keep things low key so as not to attract attention.</p>
<p>Then you realize that no one is watching, and you start to really hear the music. You start to enjoy it and you stop thinking about what you&rsquo;re doing. Maybe a little step comes into play, some hip movement. Hell, you start to sway and throw your hands around. The music is going through you and now you can&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you catch someones stare and that paralyzing feeling comes over you again. There is a quick second where you expect yourself to stop. To stop drawing that attention. Except, they aren&rsquo;t laughing. They&rsquo;re smiling. You&rsquo;re dancing, people are smiling. Good things happened.</p>
<p>The key to dancing is, then, to forget people are watching. Such is the case with blogging as well.</p>
<p>I decided when we started (much like I do when music is playing) to stop acting like people were watching me. There were times when I <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/22874096577/my-os">didn&rsquo;t really say much</a>, but that&rsquo;s OK: not all dance moves are sweet. The important part was that I was putting it out there and finding my meter.</p>
<p>I found that the more I wrote the clearer my head was. That writing it out gave a piece of mind I had been missing. There were some <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/22652704825/dark-winter-clarification">embarrassing posts</a> and some that I <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/22593112558/super-mario">don&rsquo;t think anyone read</a>, but the more I wrote, the more I found my voice. The more I let go. It became easier for my real thoughts to come out and I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of what I was saying anymore.</p>
<p>It was a freeing feeling.</p>
<p>Not just that, but therapeutic. There are some posts I&rsquo;ve gone back to frequently to read again, just to <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/23322988872/change-is-good-and-other-obvious-observations">remind myself</a> of what I wrote. To help me <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/23931898075/let-go-of-the-old-to-bring-in-the-new">stay on path</a> when I had my doubts. </p>
<p>I wish more people would open up and blog. I was scared at first. Of what, I&rsquo;m not sure. Myself perhaps. That what I had to say would make me look bad. That it would give people ammunition against me. As the saying goes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason we don&rsquo;t ask every pretty girl (or guy) we see for her number. We&rsquo;d rather think she&rsquo;d say yes that hear her say no. When I first started blogging (and Twitter for that fact) I preferred to think that I had smart, intelligent things to stay that I just didn&rsquo;t instead of trying to write them and prove that I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What arrogance. In retrospect, I really had to get over myself. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m starting to do that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy process, nor devoid of any repercussions. Some people <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/23430029949/5-things-we-done-wrong">actually did hear me</a>, but that&rsquo;s <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4003062">kind of cool</a>. The reality is I&rsquo;m still going to act as if those people aren&rsquo;t watching and just keep on dancing. I&rsquo;m enjoying it.</p>
