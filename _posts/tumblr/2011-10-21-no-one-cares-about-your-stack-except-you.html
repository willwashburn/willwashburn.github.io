<p>Growing up, my dad always had these Far Side comics on his desk. Some were over my head, but the ones that always stuck out to me we&rsquo;re the ones about Macs vs &lsquo;PC&rsquo;s vs Linux. </p>
<p>People would get really heated about which operating system was better, how the other one was inferior, and how anybody who used one of the other ones was just &ldquo;too stupid&rdquo; to get it. I watched countless real arguments crop up over this stuff. </p>
<p>We were a windows family, so I grew up a 'PC&rsquo; guy. I didn&rsquo;t have a Mac, and as such I never really used one. I learned the windows paradigm. Without knowing, I started to think that it was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way. For sometime, I equated Macs to over priced toasters*.</p>
<p>When I did eventually find myself on a Mac, everything seemed out of place. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygG5rWF5z3s">What do you mean I can&rsquo;t delete that file?!</a> How do I get to DOS?  Where are all the programs I use?!</p>
<p>Of course, <a title="BSOD anyone?" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zib2jAuMw_0">this led to frustration</a>&hellip; which led me to believe one was better than the other&hellip; which led to the comics I used to see on my dads desk when I was younger.</p>
<p>My dad (even though he&rsquo;ll admit he sometimes would flame out in a Mac vs Windows vs Linux argument from time to time) finally offered some sage advice :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best program is the one you know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes perfect sense. And it&rsquo;s all coming back full circle for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few (6?!) years learning as much as I can about the web and the technology that powers it. I started by trying to build a basic web page for a business I was building in college my freshman year. I had 0 knowledge on where to even start, so I just started googling tutorials. Eventually, I bought a book on HTML, PHP and MySQL. </p>
<p>As I learned more, I learned how little I actually knew. I kept diving deeper and deeper, only to find that there was yet another level I didn&rsquo;t fully grok. It was intimidating.</p>
<p>Then I started to hear about ruby on rails, django/python. Was I taking the right path? Was PHP really an amateaur language? </p>
<p>Suddenly I started to read posts about how PHP was an inferior language. That is wasn&rsquo;t true OOP. That ruby had a simpler syntax. That python was more flexible.</p>
<p>When I spoke about what stack I used, I always prefaced PHP with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning rails but right now I&rsquo;m using PHP&rdquo;. To be honest, I had a programmer complex - I felt impotent because I used the &ldquo;noob&quot; language.</p>
<p>But when I dove into using rails, I had to start over. How do I send mail? Where is all the support? Where are all my libraries? Suddenly simple things I could just &quot;do&rdquo; in PHP I needed to re learn in rails. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that no one cares. I just want to build the product in the best way that I can. Our users don&rsquo;t even know what language we&rsquo;re using, so why does it matter? The cool sexy languages are great- and I&rsquo;m happy to learn about them -but the bottom line is this:</p>
<p><strong>The best language is the one you know.</strong></p>
<p><small>*for the record, I love my Mac. I use all three operating systems in one environment with an awesome program called <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">synergy</a></small></p>
