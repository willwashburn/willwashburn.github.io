<p>When I got hired for my first job after college I was petrified that it would be my last. A bit ridiculous,Â admittedly, but I saw my life flash before my eyes: I&rsquo;d work this job, move up the ladder, get a wife, have some kids, and die. Before my first day of work I was imagining my death - not exactly what you&rsquo;d hope for.</p>
<p>I assumed that once I got a taste of the money, I&rsquo;d never convince myself to start a startup. I was afraid I could never again have the chance to &ldquo;risk it all&rdquo;. For some reason, I had no confidence that I would not fall into a comfort zone and that I would fight any and all change.</p>
<p>Ridiculous right? I was afraid of this new &ldquo;change&rdquo; because it would stop me &hellip;from&hellip;future&hellip; &ldquo;change&rdquo;. It made no sense. Alas, it was a real feeling for me.</p>
<p>So where did this come from? I think we give ourselves excuses to fend of change (regardless of how logical they are) because the unknown makes us feel uncomfortable. We are afraid of things not always being the same and of things we can&rsquo;t control. We get our routines and we want to keep them. It&rsquo;s harder when things change. There is a very real chance that things could get worse than they are when you start.</p>
<p>There is also a pretty good chance they&rsquo;ll get better.</p>
<p>Change is good - it challenges you. It makes you stretch. It makes you stronger. It forces you to grow as a person. With change comes opportunity we couldn&rsquo;t even imagine before it happened. You really don&rsquo;t know what could happen, and frankly, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
