<p>I bought a Kindle about a month or two back and now that I&rsquo;ve had some time with it I&rsquo;d like to draw my line in the sand; I won&rsquo;t read it if there&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;send to Kindle&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>In almost every way, the Kindle experience beats out reading a scrap of dead trees. It fits in one hand, I don&rsquo;t have to fiddle with pages, the text size is to my liking, I can have a bunch of different books with me at once, I can instantly get definitions of words on the page.. the list goes on.</p>
<p>After having had used the Kindle for a few weeks, I tried to read a traditional book I was only half way through with; I couldn&rsquo;t do it. That&rsquo;s when I decided that it was over for me. I can never again read a book printed on paper. It just feels .. pointless.</p>
<p>When you decide to make the jump as well, make sure you grab your library card. The NY public library has an ebook section where you can have copies sent to your amazon account for 2-3 weeks at a time. You don&rsquo;t even have to go to the library, you can just log into your account and find the book you want.</p>
