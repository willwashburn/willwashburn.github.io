<p>Are you a Mac or a PC?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people get pretty protective of the operating system that they use. If there was some sort of allegiance we all make when we first sign on, I think I might have missed it. Why do we get so defensive?</p>
<p>The laptop I&rsquo;m currently writing on came bundled with Windows 7, but I wiped it for Ubuntu 12.01. I love it. My desktop configuration is an i7 rig (running Windows 7) and iMac (running OSX) combo using synergy. I couldn&rsquo;t function without them. Suffice to say, I&rsquo;m using all three OS&rsquo;s every day. Why doesn&rsquo;t everyone else?</p>
<p>My Dad recently got into building &ldquo;Hackintosh&quot;s that use barebone PC components and get OSX running on it. It&rsquo;s cool stuff for sure, but one of the greatest benefits is being able to triple boot Windows, OSX and some version of Linux on the same machine.</p>
<p>I know most people love Mac hardware, and I agree that it is awesome, but the price just doesn&rsquo;t   match what you can get building it yourself. Now that you can build themwithout breaking the bank, maybe more people will be able to get into poly-os'n.</p>
<p>It may be out of your comfort zone, but as the instructions on tony mac&rsquo;s hackintosh site say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>let go of your fear of your computer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diversity is good in all other aspects of life, why not in your OS?</p>
