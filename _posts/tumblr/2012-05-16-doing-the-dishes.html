<p>Every morning, after the gym, Khaliq and  I  take turns making omlettes for ourselves for breakfast. I usually use 4 eggs with a few egg whites, mixed with some garlic and basil and topped with some cheese and turkey (Khaliq and I have seperate, defined methods: but that&rsquo;s another post for another day). By the time I finish making it, I&rsquo;m starving; I haven&rsquo;t eaten for a few hours of being awake, the aroma is all up in my face and I just worked out. </p>

<p>I never eat the omlette right away though. I always do my dishes first.</p>

<p>See, while the omlette is so very tempting and delicious and I am usually very hungry - it&rsquo;s always in my best interest to clean the dishes right away. If I leave them it gets a lot harder to clean them later - stuff gets piled on, things harden and stick and the process gets more intensive. </p>

<p>Writing code is the same way, but sometimes less obvious. There are fun problems to solve and sometimes you&rsquo;re so hungry to see if you&rsquo;re answers work you&rsquo;ll leave some dishes. You wont do the due dilligence in the beginning (like writing tests) and end up costing yourself a ton of time later on. </p>

<p>Just like a good cook leaves the kitchen cleaner than they left it, a good programmer sets up things the right way to start. This is something I&rsquo;m just starting to realize and, unfortunately, my code has lots of dishes right now.</p>
