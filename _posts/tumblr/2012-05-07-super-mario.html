<p>My head starts to feel lighter and heavier at the same time. My eyes have trouble staying open, both because of their increased weight and the sudden brightness of the world. My legs tingle and start to feel rubbery until everything stops. I’m dreaming.<br/><br/>This time, all I can hear is the super mario theme. I can hear my voice asking why I would be listening to a video game song, but it starts to fade away until I can&rsquo;t hear it anymore. I start to wonder where I am. It’s dark, but I can see myself. Not from my perspective, but from someone elses. At least I think that it’s me, it <em>feels</em> like me.</p>
<p>Where the heck am I and why is it so dark?!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the world starts rushing back to me. I see people with worried looks on their face staring at me, their voices ringing and echoing in my head. The wall behind them seems to be made of the tile board they use for ceilings.</p>
<p>No, it<em> is</em> the ceiling. I&rsquo;m on the ground.</p>
<p>They want me to stand, but my body is so tired that I don&rsquo;t think I can. Someone starts to speak to me, but it sounds like the teacher from the peanuts cartoon. When I speak, no one understands. It does sound like I&rsquo;m mumbling.</p>
<p>I let out a laugh because the experience now seems funny. I&rsquo;m starting to remember what happened. </p>
<p>It happens to my father as well and can really only be understood if it happens to you. It is, in my mind, illogical. I can&rsquo;t explain the how or the why, only that it is an absolute truth. There are few things in the world that can bring us down as quickly as talking about blood.</p>
<p>Now, this particular scene was from my high school freshman biology class and we were  <em>reviewing </em>the chapter on blood. Intent on making a good impression, I foolishly paid attention and after a few moments, began to pass out. I lost my sense of balance so much that I pulled my desk with me and fell on top of Maggie Wessling - the poor girl who decided to sit next to me.</p>
<p>This was not the only time I&rsquo;ve passed out at the mere mention of blood. In fact, recalling the story to write this has forced me to take a few breaks. It seems so silly; talking about something causes me to pass out. Inane or not, it&rsquo;s the reality I deal with and I&rsquo;ve stopped trying to change it.</p>
<p>The point is, there are somethings in life you just have to accept and manage. I wish I could be stronger when I have to talk about blood, but my body reacts and I end up feeling dizzy - or worse - on the floor.</p>
