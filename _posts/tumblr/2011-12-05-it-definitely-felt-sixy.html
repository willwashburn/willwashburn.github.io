<p>This past week, Khaliq and I decided to take a shortcut with Social Blendr; instead of building out the rest of our RSVP and deposit system, we just made a simple &ldquo;online pregame&rdquo; and sent it out. No CSS. No UI testing. Nothing but ugly, simple, <strong>ugly</strong> code (did I mention how embarrassed I am of it? I feel like my journal was just emailed out to 30 people).</p>
<p>It is part of a decidedly new trend in our development. We&rsquo;ve spent more time explaining what we&rsquo;re doing  and less time testing if it actually works. That is to say, what is the point of building out a beautiful product if people don&rsquo;t actually want it? </p>
<p>We wanted to test if a simple online game with photos was a) enjoyable to play online and b) made the beginning of events easier to walk into. The results were better than expected and a huge indicator that we’re headed in the right direction. </p>
<p>We were surprised at how long our users actually played the online pregame. We planned for the online portion to be quick; there were only 2 types of games and we assumed that most would tire easily. We also assumed that they would play once, see the people and questions, and then forget about it. Our line of thinking was compounded by the fact that we build such a featureless prototype; surely no one would put up with it’s lackluster design. We built and anticipated for a 3 minute game.</p>
<p>What we found was that people played for an average of 8 minutes, with the max being around 15 minutes. People came back too. One out of every 3 people came back to play later for a second and even third time. This was totally unexpected. </p>
<p>Even better, people loved it. The event was a huge hit &ndash; with a terrible product!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to build out some more tests, and frankly, I can&rsquo;t wait to write some more ugly, ugly, terribly ugly, code.</p>
