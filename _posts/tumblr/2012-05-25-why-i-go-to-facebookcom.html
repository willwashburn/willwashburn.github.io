<p><em>This post is part of a new series called #BroBlogging. Khaliq and I will share a topic and independently write about it. His post is <a href="http://blog.khaliqgant.com/post/23757569460/why-i-go-to-facebook-com">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>This could just as easily be titled &ldquo;Why I don&rsquo;t go to Facebook.com as much anymore&rdquo;, but let&rsquo;s stick to the point. Here are some reasons I still visit Facebook and some commentary on what I think it means for Facebook&rsquo;s future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Keeping up with Facebook drama is like a Soap Opera for me. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens in next week&rsquo;s episode!!</span></p>

<p><strong>Judging people I don&rsquo;t really care about<br/></strong><em>Who is dating who now? Did SHE have a baby with HIM? Oh snap, she really got fat. Damn, he got in shape. Wait, who is this again? Wow, they really are living the life.</em></p>
<p>Most of my news feed is filled with people I sort of knew, never really knew, or who have left my life in one form or another. Is my life more enriched seeing their life stories? I&rsquo;m not sure, but I know I am curious to see who does what and where they end up. Just not curious enough to pick up the phone, and you know, actually call them. So, Facebook has become a place I go to to judge people I used to know. Sad, true, and honest.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this person?<br/></strong><em>Wait, Stephanie who? Oh the blonde? No, Jeff&rsquo;s girlfriend? Wait, who? OOOOOHHH her.<br/></em></p>
<p>If I need to see a picture of someone, I go on Facebook and pretty quickly find a picture of them. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to &ldquo;see&rdquo; someone. Writing this makes it sound really creepy, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one who does this.</p>
<p><strong>Messaging a normal person (whose email I don&rsquo;t have)<br/></strong>If I don&rsquo;t have their number or email and they don&rsquo;t have twitter, I&rsquo;ll use Facebook to send a message to someone. It beats searching anywhere else, even though Facebook&rsquo;s messaging is so bad I&rsquo;m not sure they even get it.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing photos of _________ event that I was at<br/></strong>If I&rsquo;ve been tagged, I want to see the photos. If there was an event, I want to see if I was in one of the photos taken at the event. I&rsquo;m sounding pretty narcissistic, but I&rsquo;m focusing on being honest here. Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Things Not On This List<br/></strong></p>
<ol><li>Connecting with brands </li>
<li>Connecting with close friends</li>
<li>Sharing pictures with family</li>
<li>Finding interesting articles</li>
<li>Figuring out what a company does / &ldquo;who&rdquo; a company is</li>
<li>When I&rsquo;m looking to buy anything</li>
</ol><div>Facebook still has (for me) some ground to cover if they want to be the source of information in these areas. Facebook has become a social directory, but in a much more public way than would allow some of these things (ergo I&rsquo;d feel weird sharing &ldquo;family photos&rdquo;). It hasn&rsquo;t exactly become a corporate brand directory though, even though I think they&rsquo;ve tried. With that in mind, I don&rsquo;t think of brands on Facebook and generally ignore them. Sharing links and articles is not the reason I go to Facebook, although I&rsquo;m sure some people use it for that.<br/> </div>
<div>I find that my uses are generally unhealthy/negative, so I don&rsquo;t have the same positive feelings I used to have for it. In the beginning, it was fun and exciting - just my close friends from school. It was positive. We shared photos and stories and posted jokes on each other&rsquo;s walls.<br/> </div>
<div>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;ve left that time in my life, but it&rsquo;s become something much more perverse. Either I don&rsquo;t use it in the right way or it&rsquo;s naturally run it&rsquo;s course. It&rsquo;s a negative time sink for me, despite what I think it could be or have been.<br/> </div>
<div>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll still tune in for next weeks episode though, just like some cheesy reality television show.</div>
