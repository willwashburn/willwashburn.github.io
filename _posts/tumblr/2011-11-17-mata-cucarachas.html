<p>If my life were a book, this chapter would be called &ldquo;Cockroaches&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>You see, I sat here this morning eating a bowl of cereal - honey bunches of oats, for the scrupulous readers - and before the spoon hit my mouth I noticed that in the bowl from where it left a small cockroach sat and reveled in my milk. Without missing a beat, I calmly and slowly grabbed him with my index and thumb and threw him in the trash.</p>
<p>For a moment, I paused; how the hell did I get to a point where I was killing cockroaches with my bare hands?</p>
<p>This past week has been a blur. For sometime now Khaliq and I have known that this month would be a challenge (so much so that we <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/12316569253/the-homeless-entrepreneur">considered being homeless</a>) but I&rsquo;m not sure I was prepared for speed at which it would all go down. One day I&rsquo;m relaxing on the back porch of a quiet 3 story house with my dog <a href="http://blog.willwashburn.com/post/11730254065/third-co-founder-isnt-really-putting-the-same" title="Einstein">Einstein</a>, the next I&rsquo;m squishing roaches in a small, shared, studio apartment in New York City.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell what got me here, but I&rsquo;m excited. </p>
<p>Does that sound strange? Maybe it is. The fact of the matter is it&rsquo;s part of the forward progress for Social Blendr. We&rsquo;re where we need to be, we have the tools to make it happen, and we&rsquo;re on our way. </p>
<p>Sure, there might be some &hellip; disgusting, ugly, and down right creepy discomforts&hellip; but if it helps us make Social Blendr a reality then I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>Bring on the roaches.</p>
