<p><a href="http://www.socialblendr.com">Social Blendr</a>. Our startup. Our baby. How much would I give up to see it happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;d do anything because I really believe in what we&rsquo;re doing. ANYTHING. I mean, what&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Life has a funny way of offering you chances to prove what you think you believe. It&rsquo;s one thing to say it, it&rsquo;s another to actually go out and do it.</p>
<p>So would I be homeless? </p>
<p>In a lot of ways I&rsquo;ve already given up a lot for Social Blendr (my potential career in Finance and all that entails - job security, health benefits etc). But this, this is different. This is my every day life we&rsquo;re talking about here. This is my bed that I go home to. My dog. My kitchen and the cheap, home cooked meals it provides. My&hellip;comfort.</p>
<p>Better question.. would this even work?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the hypothesis. Social Blendr&rsquo;s biggest cost are our living expenses. Our biggest living expense is rent. If we got rid of rent, well, we&rsquo;d be able to last a little longer to get our product and more importantly -our revenue stream- ready. </p>
<p>The timing is right. Our current lease is ending on the 15th (a whopping 10 days away) and we&rsquo;re not sure what the next step will be. We don&rsquo;t exactly have the money to put down a new security deposit, broker fee and month deposit. So the question popped up - what if we just rented a desk at a co-working location and couch surfed our way to profitability?</p>
<p>(ok, so not truly homeless)</p>
<p>Whats the alternative? Not doing it full time. Side-project it, get some jobs, and see where it takes us. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve swayed back and forth on the issue ranging from &ldquo;screw it, we can do anything and this is the best way to cut costs!&rdquo; to &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll end up burning out before December, this is the dumbest idea we&rsquo;ve ever had&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With less than a few weeks to go we&rsquo;ve got a decision to make - hustle hard and be homeless, or be more realistic and take the slow and steady approach.</p>
<p>On one hand, I think costs are the only thing you can really control. Whereas revenues are hit or miss, I&rsquo;m acutely aware of what we&rsquo;re spending. Cutting out rent would give us a lottttt of breathing room. I think we could make it work too. We don&rsquo;t need much to get by, and we spend 18 hours of the day at our desks or at events anyways.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t discount the PR benefits! I know I&rsquo;d do anything to make the Social Blendr vision come true, but not everybody can be so sure. This is a pretty easy way to show that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;committed&rdquo;. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I think my sister hit the nail on the head when she said &ldquo; I think this is a terrible idea&rdquo;. The startup world is renowned for being a rollercoaster, and I can&rsquo;t  imagine fighting through the <a href="http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/storage/articles/trough-of-sorrow-article/startup_curve.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1314280788364">trough of sorrow</a> after spending a few months on a series of friends couches. This feels a little bit like going into battle naked.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t decided yet, but I&rsquo;ll keep you in the loop - either from my new apartment or a friends couch.</p>
